The Organic Profile Block is a custom block for the Gutenberg content editor. It displays a profile card with an image, name, title, biography, and social media links.

== Description ==

The Organic Profile Block is designed to work with the WordPress 5 block editor and [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/ "Gutenberg Plugin"). This custom block is designed to display personal profiles. It includes options to add a profile image, name, title, biography, and social media links. The social media options include icon links to personal profiles for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and email. The profile block is an excellent solution for creating author profiles on posts, staff or employee pages, and testimonials.

Additionally, this plugin is a great reference for budding WordPress block developers. Since WordPress blocks are developed in Javascript, creating a block can be intimidating for WordPress developers more familiar with PHP, HTML, and CSS. That's why we developed the Profile Block using the Javascript ES5 language, which does not require the use of a compiler to edit the code. For more information, please refer to our [How To Create A Custom Block](https://organicthemes.com/create-custom-block-wordpress-gutenberg/ "Create Custom Block") article.

A premium version of the block is included in the [Organic Blocks Bundle](https://organicthemes.com/blocks/ "Organic Blocks Bundle") plugin. The bundle includes 9 premium blocks for the Gutenberg editor. The premium Profile Block can display unlimited social media links, and features several more options for modifying the profile image size, colors, and style.
